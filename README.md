# Convolutional Codes & The Viterbi algorithm

Convolutional coding adds redundant information to a stream of bits in order to increase reliability in noisy communication channels.
The Viterbi algorithm is an efficient way to accurately decode the message at the receiver in the presence of bit errors.
